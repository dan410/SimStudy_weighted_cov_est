Simulation study using spatially derived weights for estimating the covariance function
=========================


This simulation study provides insight into how the covariance function estimator behaves when curves are spatially dependent. The main idea is that under spatial dependence, curves that are near each other will exhibit some amount of redundancy. By down-weighting spatially clustered curves, we may be able to more appropriately include information about the contribution of each curve to the underlying process. That is, curves that are located in high point-intensity areas should not be included in the estimation as if they were statistically independent. 

We propose a weighting scheme that is derived from the spatial point intensity (number of locations per unit area). Let
```
weight_i = f(lambda_i)
```
where the function `f()` we consider is a power function: `f(x) = x^p`. For example, when `p = 1/2` the weight for `curve_i` is equal to the square root of the point intensity at `location_i`.

Note: this approach is about relative weighting. Locations on a regular grid (i.e. constant point intensity) will receive equal weighting. This approach will only be beneficial under situation of non-constant point intensity.
